                <p><b>Title: </b>“Introduction to Python”, “Python – Functions, Files, Objects”, “Data science Libraries in Python”</p>
                <p><b>Detailed Report: </b><br> One of the main goals of COEP’s DSAI club is to teach students of COEP about basics of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. By teaching students about Python programming language the club made sure that there is a basic foundation on which the students can create their career in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
                  The first and second lecture of workshop took place on 21st and 23rd January 2019, in Cognizant lab. The goal of workshop was to give students a basic hands-on basics of Python Programming Language. This was a CodeAlong (Students executed the programs that were taught on the projector in the lab immediately on the lab computers). There were over 300 registrations but considering the capacity of the lab only 250 were given entry. The workshop was open to students of all branches, year and courses. We saw students from PhD, Mtech other than computer science attend the lecture. Students of branches other than Computer and IT constituted about 45% of attendance.
                  Third lecture was conducted on 28th January 2019 in Mini auditorium. It provided students the basis for usage of libraries related to machine learning. Students brought their laptops and programmed along with instructor. This lecture also gave the basic idea about the software development environment for machine learning.
                  Aditya Khandelwal, Club Technical secretary conducted these lectures. Suraj Sawant Sir was there for supervising and assistance.

            <p><b>Title: </b>Introduction to Machine Learning, Hands on Linear Regression from Scratch</p>
            <p><b>Detailed Report: </b><br> After giving students foundation in Python programming language, we conducted lectures to give students foundation in Machine Learning Libraries in Python and Theoretical Machine Learning, so that they can easily learn more about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science without any more assistance.
              The next 2 lectures of our lecture series were – “Introduction to Machine Learning” and “Hands on Linear Regression from Scratch”. We conducted them on 30th January and 13th February 2019 in Mini Auditorium. The lectures were each for 2 hours each starting at 5:30PM.
              In “Introduction to Machine Learning” we taught about the basic of machine learning including introduction to basics of different machine learning algorithms, basic terms of machine learning, measures of precision and training. We gave students an overview about the whole field and how each algorithm fits in to the broader perspective.
              In “Hands on Linear Regression from Scratch”, we focused on algorithm – Linear Regression. It is one the most basic machine learning algorithm. We created that algorithm from scratch without using any readymade libraries. Students programmed along the instructor and were able to recreate the algorithm.
              Aditya Khandelwal, club technical secretary conducted these lectures. Suraj Sawant Sir was there to supervise and assist.

            <p><b>Detailed Report: </b><br> After taking 5 lectures on Python and Machine Learning basics, we decided to take club inductions.
              We conducted Round 1 of Induction on 22nd February 2019 from 6:30PM to 8:00 PM in AC 202 in Academic Complex.  A written test was conducted. Students were provided question papers from us. The test syllabus was all the things which we had taught in the last 5 lectures.
              Students will be called for interview and a task round after their test papers assessment.

            <p><b>Detailed Report: </b><br> COEP's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Club in association with Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology Organised a hands on session on 'Intel's OpenVino Toolkit For Deep Learning' by Mr. Omkar Khair on Saturday 21st September 2019. Mr. Omkar is Intel Innovator and Cloud Consultant at RapidCircle. In this 4 hour long seesion Omkar covered basics of Machine learning and Deep learning followed by Playing with 2 datasets Fashion MNIST and Cats and Dogs dataset where the participants analyzed and built a model on the dataset to predict the end result. After  this he covered Intel Open Vino toolkit basics, its advantages, its use case in real life, followed by hands-on installation and demos with MobileNet and SqueezeNet. Omkar also demonstrated a small project on Raspberry Pi and Movidius to detect a person in real-time . Overall the Session was a great success.
